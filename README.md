# First-Project
High school C# project

This is the first real program I made. Though I've made smaller programs before, this was a full on game that I developed in my high school computer science class. It does not use any object-oriented programming, but makes use of sprites. It is a game based off of Yoshi killing Bowser. It is very simple.

You can launch the game by opening Assignment3Zelda.exe in the bin folder. Instructions to play the game will be prompted when you open the application.
